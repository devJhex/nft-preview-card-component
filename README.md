## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development
I think this was a very good challenge for me because it taught me more of trying to go around a solution than looking a group of rules and statements, I hope to repeat this project with Tailwind CSS.
